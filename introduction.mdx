# Migrating Auth

It takes 5 minutes to set up auth with clerk. You get user management, organization management, roles, and much more. But what if you already are using an auth system, and you have users or even organizations?

This guide is here to help you through the process.

## Using Expand and Contract.
 
Our auth migration follows a similiar pattern to the common expand and contract process. [Read More here](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/types/relational/expand-and-contract-pattern)

## Introducing the Migrations API

That's why we made the **Migrations API**. It allows you to easily call the clerk api, but hides all the complexity of managing user ids, rate limits, api call ordering, and queue management from you.

With the **Migrations API**, what was once a nightmarish task becomes a manageable expand-and-contract data migration. This API not only provides you with **observability** through a live dashboard and logs but also **flexibility**. You can pause, restart, or even abandon a migration without risk, all while maintaining zero downtime. By the end of the process, your users might not even realize they've been transitioned to a new system.
