# Migrating Auth

It takes 5 minutes to set up auth with clerk. You get user management, organization management, roles, and much more. But what if you already are using an auth system, and you already have users?

This guide is here to help you through the process.

## Using Expand and Contract.

Our auth migration follows a similar pattern to the common expand-and-contract process, providing a reversible and zero-downtime migration experience.

However, because migrating auth is more complex than simply migrating data, we've made a <b>Migrations Trickle Wrapper</b> React component, a <b>Clerk Migrations API</b>, and a <b>Clerk Migrations Dashboard</b> to help you with the migration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tell Us Who's On Your Site">
    In order to ensure data integrity and allow reversibility, we need to know
    about current and future users on your site. [Read
    Here](/migrations-trickle-wrapper) to add and configure the migrations
    trickle wrapper.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tell Us Who's Not On Your Site">
    There will be users who we won't know about, simply because they're not on
    your site. Batch those users in with the <b>Clerk Migrations Dashboard</b>
    [Read More Here](/batch-importing-users)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Syncing Your Data to Clerk.">
    Stub out a `POST /get-users-by-ids` function <b>in your backend</b>, and we
    will start syncing your users to Clerk based on the ids sent from both the
    Migrations Trickle Wrapper and the Clerk Migrations Dashboard batch tool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify Your Codebase to use Clerk">
    While your data is being synced, modify and test your codebase using Clerk.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Optional: Sign in Users to Clerk Before Going Live">
    Once you are ready to commit to Clerk, you can use the Migrations Dashboard
    to sign in users to Clerk <b>before</b> going live. This makes it so your
    users never know they've been migrated! [Read More About Our
    Seamless-Login](/signing-in-users-before-going-live)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch To Clerk in Production">
    Once your users are migrated and your codebase works with Clerk, you can
    push to production. Everything after this point is <b>not reversibile</b>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue Monitoring The Migration Dashboard Post-Migration">
    Although all your users are switched to Clerk, we recommend to continue to
    monitor the Migrations Dashboard to make sure everything is working. [Read
