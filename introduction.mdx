# Migrating Auth Is Hard

It takes 5 minutes to set up auth with clerk. You get user management, organization management, roles, and much more. But what if you already are using an auth system, and you have users or even organizations?

Well then it's not so easy.

If you want to do a zero-downtime migration there are gotchas around every corner, 200 edges cases to worry about, rate limits, multiple ids floating around, different sessions, it's a nightmare.

Is the solution then to take your app offline for several hours, rushing to transfer all your critical data to a new authentication system, one that is impossible to rollback from if you mess up the transfer?

## Introducing the Migrations API

That's why we made the **Migrations API**. It allows you to easily call the clerk api, but hides all the complexity of managing user ids, rate limits, api call ordering, and queue management from you.

With the **Migrations API**, what was once a nightmarish task becomes a manageable expand-and-contract data migration. This API not only provides you with **observability** through a live dashboard and logs but also **flexibility**. You can pause, restart, or even abandon a migration without risk, all while maintaining zero downtime. By the end of the process, your users might not even realize they've been transitioned to a new system.
